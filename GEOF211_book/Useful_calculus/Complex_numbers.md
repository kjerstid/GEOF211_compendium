# Complex numbers

The imaginary unit, $i$ is defined as:
```{math}
:label: eq:Complex_i
i=\sqrt{-1}
````

A complex number is and expression of the form: 

```{math}
:label: eq:Complex_def
z=x+iy
```

The distance from origo, the the point (x,y) in the complex plane is called the modulus and is defined as:

```{math}
:label: eq:Complex_modulus
|z|=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}
```

The norm of a complex  number (equivalent of the vector length in the complex plane) is:

```{math}
:label: eq:Complex_norm_squared
|z|^2=x^2+y^2
```

The modulus of a product of two complex numbers $z$ and $w$ is:

```{math}
:label: eq:Complex_modulus_product
|zw|=|z||w|
```

The modulus of the sum of two complex numbers, also called "The triangle inequality" is defined:

```{math}
:label: eq:Complex_triangle_identity
|z+w|<|z|+|w|
```
