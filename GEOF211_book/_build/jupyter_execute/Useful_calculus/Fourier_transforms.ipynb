Mathematically, we would say that the temperature is a function of time, $f(t)$. Similarly, the space domain represents how the signal (for example air temperature) is changing with space or distance, $x$. Then, the resulting function would be $f(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a meaningful interpretation of the frequency domain, we must first approximate our signal by a superposition of many waves with different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. The more frequencies we include in the superposition, the better the approximation is.\n",

If we let $t\\rightarrow \\infty$ and include enough wave frequencies to allow $n/T \\rightarrow \\xi$ we can now write a function of the amount of energy as in terms of each wave. This is how our signal looks in the frequency domain, and this function is called the Fourier transform:\n",
