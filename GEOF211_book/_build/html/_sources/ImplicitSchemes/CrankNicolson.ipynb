    "# The Crank-Nicholson Scheme for linear advection\n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, all schemes have time step limitations in the form of the CFL condition $c\\Delta t/\\Delta x \\leq 1$. One way to overcome that limitation is to use *implicit* schemes, where the spatial derivatives are evaluated at $t^{n+1}$. One such scheme is the Crank-Nicholson scheme, which was, originally designed o solve the diffusion equation (heat conduction). Here, we show the Crank-Nicolson scheme for linear advection:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "  \\frac{u_m^{n+1}-u_m^n}{\\Delta t} = -\\frac{a}{2\\Delta x}\\left(\\frac{u_{m+1}^{n+1}-u_{m-1}^{n+1}}{2} + \\frac{u_{m+1}^{n}-u_{m-1}^{n}}{2}\\right)\n",
    "$$ (eq:schemeCrankNicholson)\n",
    "\n",
    "The scheme is a modification of the FTCS (Forward in time, centered in space) scheme. It uses the forward approximation to the time derivative at $t^n$ and the average of the centred approximations of the space derivative at $t^n$ and $t^{n+1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of looking at {eq}`eq:schemeCrankNicholson` is that the left hand side (LHS) is a centred approximation of the time derivative at $t^{n+1/2}$ and the averaging of the spatial derivatives provides an estimate of the spatial derivative at $t^{n+1/2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the terms at $t^{n+1}$ poses a complication because these are not known at time $t^n$. Therefore, the scheme is not an explicit time marching scheme as we have seen so far, but one where the solution is implicit in the scheme itself, hence the designation of *implicit* scheme. To obtain the unknown values at $t^{n+1}$, a linear system of equations must be solved. \n",
