# Resource pages for GEOF211 - Numerical Modeling

This is a compendium for use in in the course GEOF211 at the Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen. 

In this course you learn to use numerical methods to solve simple problems in fluid dynamics. We study exact and numerical solutions of partial differential equations linked to advection, diffusion, oscillation and wave processes, and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different numerical schemes.

You will learn to use methods to solve initial value problems and solve diagnostic boundary value problems.
