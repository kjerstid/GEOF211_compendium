# Inertial oscillations

Inertial oscillations is a special phenomenon occuring when EarthÂ´s rotation (coriolis)  is the only force that cause local acceleration

Starting with the 2D Navier Stokes equation {eq}`eq:NavierStokes` and removiong all terms except local acellaration and coriolis, we are left with:

```{math}
:label: eq:InertialOscillatios
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-fv&=0&\quad (i)\\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}+fu&=0&\quad (ii)
\end{aligned} 
```
We can combine these equations, by expressing the as $U=u+iv \quad(iii)$. By differentiating $(iii)$ with respect to time, and inserting the  expressions from $(i)$ and $(ii)$, we get:

```{math}
:label: eq:InertialOscillatios_imag
\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}=-ifU
```

This is a classical first order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) with the solution:

```{math}
:label: eq:InertialOscillatios_imag_solution
U=Ae^{ift} = A(cos(ft)-isin(ft))
```

If we assume an initial condition on the form $U(t=0)U_0=u_0+iv_0$, this gives us $U_0=A(cos(0)-isin(0))=A(1-0)=A$. We can now write out the full solution as:

```{math}
:label: eq:InertialOscillatios_imag_solution_ini
U=U_0e^{ift} = U_0(cos(ft)-isin(ft))
```

**Try it!:**
Try for yourself to set $U_0=i$ and find the $u$ and $v$ at timesteps $0, \frac{\pi}{4f}, \frac{\pi}{2f}, \frac{3\pi}{4f}, \frac{\pi}{f}$. Does these values match the sketch below?

The inertial oscillations do not move in space like the advection or diffusion equations did (we have no $\partial/\partial x$-terms). The solutions provide a change of current/wind direction with time only. The result is a circular rotation in the ...

 and we can plot the solutions as functions of time. The solution will be a circular movement that is stationary with time. In real life, there is seldom/never a pure inertial balance, and the inertial oscillations will be advected by the background current as depicted in Figure {ref}`fig:InertialOscillation`.
