# Stability of numerical schemes

In the previous chapter we analyzed the linear advection equation and its discretized version and we found that the solution could:
* Remain bounded or not.
* If it remained bounded, it could converge to the solution of the exact equation or not.

These behaviours are deeply related to the concept of *numerical stability* of the underlying numerical scheme used to discretize the equation. Moreover, they are common to every numerical scheme, so it is advantageous to devise a general methodology applicable to all numerical schemes.
