# Grids

When we make numerical models, we discretize the equations by splitting up time and space into finite dimension elements such as, e.g., line segments in 1D, areas (rectangles, triangles, etc) in 2D, or volumetric boxes in 3D. You can select the shape of the finte elements and arrange them in various ways to obtain optimal solutions for the relevant  physics of the problem you are solving.
