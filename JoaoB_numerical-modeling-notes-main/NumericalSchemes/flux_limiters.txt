There are several flux limiter functions that are commonly used in numerical methods for solving hyperbolic 
partial differential equations. These include:

Minmod limiter: The minmod limiter is a simple and robust limiter that is widely used in finite volume and 
finite difference schemes. The minmod limiter takes the minimum of the slopes to the left and right of the 
cell, and then applies a sign function to ensure that the slope is positive for positive values of the solution 
and negative for negative values.

Superbee limiter: The superbee limiter is a more complex limiter that is designed to provide a higher order of 
accuracy while still being TVD. The superbee limiter is defined by a piecewise linear function that interpolates 
between the minmod and the maximum of the slopes to the left and right of the cell.

Van Leer limiter: The Van Leer limiter is another TVD limiter that is commonly used in finite volume schemes. 
The Van Leer limiter is defined by a hyperbolic tangent function that smoothly transitions between the minmod 
and the maximum of the slopes to the left and right of the cell.

MC limiter: The MC limiter is a more aggressive limiter that is designed to provide high accuracy in regions 
of smooth solution while still being TVD. The MC limiter is defined by a quadratic function that interpolates 
between the minmod and the maximum of the slopes to the left and right of the cell.

Koren limiter: The Koren limiter is a TVD limiter that is designed to provide high accuracy in regions of smooth 
solution while limiting oscillations near discontinuities. The Koren limiter is defined by a piecewise quadratic 
function that interpolates between the minmod and the maximum of the slopes to the left and right of the cell.

These are just a few examples of the many flux limiter functions that are used in numerical methods for solving 
hyperbolic partial differential equations. The choice of flux limiter depends on the specific application and the 
desired trade-off between accuracy and stability.
