# Numerical schemes for the linear 1-d advection equation

In this chapter we shall study several numerical schemes applied to the {ref}`linear advection equation <linearadvection:intro>`. The purpose of the study is to illustrate the concepts learned so far about the analysis of numerical scheme, as we apply them to solve a simple model of the advection process.
