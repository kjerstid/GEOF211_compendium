Numerical and analytical techniques are used to study the types of computational noise present in each grid system.

For fine-scale resolution ({$<$}50 km), as in mesoscale ocean eddy models, it is shown that the C-scheme (in which the zonal velocity is carried at points to the east and west of the point of a rectangular grid where the height is carried, with the meridional velocity carried to the north and south of the height point) can be free of noise for the gravest mode (as in a two-layer model).},

If the governing equations are linear, if the basic-state is one of rest, and if the initial field of motion is geostrophically balanced, then no change in this equilibrium state occurs. However, nongeostrophic initial conditions excite transient gravity-inertia waves that redistribute mass and momentum to ultimately establish a geostrophic steady state, whose potential vorticity is equal to the potential vorticity of the initial state. A steady state may not become established if, for example, hydrodynamic instabilities occur or if wave energy becomes trapped because of inherent refractive properties of the medium. Some examples, which illustrate the properties of geostrophic adjustment and nonadjustment, are presented and discussed. A simple model, which incorporates gross features of atmospheric and ocean flows, is also presented in order to summarize the relationships between the spatial scales associated with the initial conditions and the partition of energy between the allowable modes of oscillation, both transient and steady. The oceanic response to imposed stresses from atmospheric circulation systems and the atmospheric response to sources of wave energy, which includes the introduction of incorrect initial data into numerical simulations, provide practical applications of the theory.},

In the case of the ocean, this oscillation will include the form of ``long'' or ``tidal'' waves. A previous investigation by Rossby indicated that the period of such waves would be twelve pendulum hours. However, on the basis of earlier research by Lord Kelvin the period would be shorter. In the present paper the author removes the seeming inconsistency between the results of these two investigations. He shows that such inertial type waves are quickly damped out by means of rapid spreading out of the energy involved. This factor may be of importance in explaining why inertial oscillations are observed with such difficulty in the atmosphere.},

It is a two-step algorithm, and contains a small amount of implicit numerical diffusion that makes it numerically stable without having to use any explicit filtering. It uses a nonstaggered grid. A detailed comparison with the leapfrog and Smolarkiewicz schemes is presented using the nonlinear advection equation and the Euler equations for a variety of conditions at different Courant numbers. Of the schemes tested, the unfiltered leapfrog is the least acceptable for the solution of nonlinear equations. Although it is numerically stable for linear problems, when used to solve nonlinear equations (without using any explicit filtering) it becomes numerically unstable or nonlinearly unstable. Furthermore, it introduces large phase errors, and produces better results with small Courant numbers. The MacCormack scheme is nonlinearly stable, produces modest amounts of numerical dispersion and diffusion, has no phase speed error, and works best at Courant numbers close to 1. When applied to nonlinear equations, the Smolarkiewicz scheme exhibits the least amount of numerical diffusion but more numerical dispersion than the MacCormack scheme. For stability it requires Courant numbers equal to or smaller than 0.5. In practical applications, we recommend the MacCormack scheme for the solution of the nonlinear equations, and either the Smolarkiewicz or the MacCormack scheme for equations involving conservation of a passive scalar.},

  abstract = {Abstract In a previous paper, the authors discussed the numerical properties of the MacCormack scheme, a finite-difference technique widely used in aerospace simulations. Here the authors report results of its application to the simulation, in two dimensions, of the development of a fully compressible buoyant bubble. The model uses the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations applied to an inviscid, adiabatic atmosphere. It uses a nonstaggered grid. Both lateral and top boundary conditions are open and essentially reflection-first. The model produced reasonable solutions with no explicit numerical filtering. In regions with locally steep gradients, the MacCormack scheme produces numerical oscillations that locally distort the solution but do not lead to numerical unstability. These results are compared with those of Droegemeier and of Carpenter et al., who show results using a filtered staggered leapfrog scheme. The fields computed by both schemes are very similar, with those, from the filtered leapfrog being smoother. The major difference is that the speed of propagation of the significant flow features is slower with the leapfrog scheme. The advantage of the MacCormack scheme is that it is numerically stable with no tuned filtering and gives its best results at Courant numbers four times larger than can be used with a leapfrog scheme. In long-term integrations in the presence of very steep gradients, numerically induced oscillations would require some degree of explicit filtering to control these numerical oscillations and improve the quality of the solution. The use of a second-order Fickian filter with the MacCormack scheme weakens the gradients.},

This numerical boundary condition which originally used the leap frog scheme (Orlanski 1976) is shown to be made more accurate by the use of the upstream method. In this form it is tested in a two-dimensional model of a density current and is stable. the boundary becomes effectively transparent to incident disturbances, even under the severe test of allowing the density current head to propagate upstream and through the boundary, thus changing initial inflow to strong outflow. An analysis is presented of various extrapolation and radiation boundary conditions, involving calculation of their accuracy for waves and more general solutions. the leading terms in the truncation error are compared, and for general disturbances some have second order accuracy, while for solutions of the wave equation, it is shown that the radiation condition is third order. It can be made fourth order, for both leapfrog and upstream differencing, by the use of an extrapolation formula to give a better numerical estimate for c. This condition derives its greater accuracy from the use of values at seven (space and time) gridpoints, in contrast to the original scheme which used four, and standard extrapolation formulae which use, at most, three points.},

The constant grid flux form schemes are shown to be an improvement over the traditional central differencing commonly used in ocean models. In addition, nonoscillatory versions of the scheme, which employ flux limiters, are explored. The limiters are based on total variation diminishing concepts and are applied to higher-order (in space) versions of the constant grid flux form scheme. The constant grid flux form schemes are Crowley-type upstream-biased Eulerian advection schemes. They are mass conserving and possess small amplitude and phase errors. The flux limiters prevent the under- and overshooting associated with the numerical dispersion of the unlimited schemes. The limited schemes are easy to implement, efficient, and nonoscillatory. Of these schemes the third-order and fifth-order versions employing the PDM limiter are shown to give optimal results for the advection of scalars under a number of test cases. There is a trade-off between the greater accuracy of the fifth-order scheme and the requirement of a larger grid stencil associated with a greater computational cost. Higher-order nonoscillatory schemes can easily be developed for three-dimensional primitive equation modeling. A multidimensional version is presented that employs a modified time-splitting technique. It is shown to be suitable for three-dimensional primitive equation modeling.},

When the flow is organized initially as a ``linear'' sound wave, it is equivalent to the solution of an ``advection equation''. The flow that evolves in this way from an initial state is analyzed by means of a Fourier series in space, with time-dependent coefficients. These coefficients can be determined exactly when the initial velocity is a pure sinusoid. The result is such that the Fourier series in space is a Kapteyn series in time. The series is valid up to the time of shock formation. Throughout this interval the lowest harmonics inferred from severely truncated spectral equations are in good agreement with the exact solution. However, the spectral representation becomes very inefficient as the discontinuous state is approached.},

  abstract = {Abstract Traditional analysis of finite-difference and finite-element schemes used in numerical weather prediction has concentrated almost exclusively on an analysis of the accuracy with which the scheme simulates the phase speeds involved. In this paper we show, using the transfer function formulation common in the design of electrical filters, that these numerical schemes also have important amplitude distortion characteristics, which must be considered in any complete analysis. Our analysis leads to conclusions about the appropriateness of unstaggered arrangements of grid points to primitive equation models commonly used in weather prediction.},

  abstract = {Numerical integrations of finite-difference analogs of systems of nonlinear partial differential equations, such as those arising in atmospheric dynamics, are subject to computational instability from a variety of causes. One type of instability is produced by a spurious, nonlinear growth of high-frequency components that may be introduced by roundoff, truncation, and observational error. This type of instability, first discussed by N. A. Phillips, can be suppressed by a suitable choice of finite-difference method or by the use of a filter that selectively damps the high-frequency components. Though much effort is being devoted to the development of stable finite-difference procedures, and considerable success has been achieved, all such methods involve high-frequency smoothing either implicitly or explicitly. It is therefore important that the effects of such filtering be fully understood. Filtering and smoothing operators are developed for use in conjunction with the numerical integration of nonlinear systems and for other purposes. The general procedure is demonstrated for simple one-dimensional operators and the properties of such operators are thoroughly explored. The development is then expanded to allow for compound operators designed to suit some particular requirement and further extended to more than one dimension. Both real and complex operators are discussed. Reverse smoothers or wave amplifiers are introduced, and some of the problems associated with their use are discussed. A general procedure is outlined for the construction of an `ideal' low-pass filter; that is, a filter that removes the shortest resolvable wave component (the 2-grid-interval wave) but restores all other wave components as close as is desired to their original amplitudes without amplifying or changing the phase of any wave component. Finally, the effects, sometimes disastrous, of finite domains on the properties of the smoothing operators are explored for a variety of common boundary assumptions.},

  abstract = {A numerical technique, called a `weighted average flux' (WAF) method, for the solution of initial-value problems for hyperbolic conservation laws is presented. The intercell fluxes are defined by a weighted average through the complete structure of the solution of the relevant Riemann problem. The aim in this definition is the achievement of higher accuracy without the need for solving `generalized' Riemann problems or adding an anti-diffusive term to a given first-order upwind method. Second-order accuracy is proved for a model equation in one space dimension; for nonlinear systems second-order accuracy is supported by numerical evidence. An oscillation-free formulation of the method is easily constructed for a model equation. Applications of the modified technique to scalar equations and nonlinear systems gives results of a quality comparable with those obtained by existing good high resolution methods. An advantage of the present method is its simplicity. It also has the potential for efficiency, because it is well suited to the use of approximations in the solution of the associated Riemann problem. Application of WAF to multidimensional problems is illustrated by the treatment using dimensional splitting of a simple model problem in two dimensions.},
